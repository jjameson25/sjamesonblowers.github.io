## About Me

I am currently pursuing an MA in General Linguistics at the University at Buffalo, with hopes to pursue a PhD in the near future. I am interested in Hispanic Linguistics, Language Preservation and Revitalization, Morphology, Semantics, and Variation. My capstone research is focused on semantic variation in Argentine Spanish, with hopes of exploring a novel branch of sociolinguistics. 

When I'm not researching, I spend my free time trying to keep all my plants alive (doing pretty well so far!), prepping for my ongoing Dungeons and Dragons campaign, or working on any of several ongoing arts & crafts projects I have going at any given time.
