For my undergraduate research, completed in 2019, I performed an acoustic analysis of the cordobes dialect of Argentine Spanish. 
Using primary data from participant interviews, I discovered further evidence of the documented linguistic process of lle√≠smo, whereby 
younger speakers of the language were realizing the voiced alveolar fricative as a voiceless alveolar fricative, while older speakers maintained
voicing.
